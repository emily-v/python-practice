## Load Balancer

Prompt adapted from Coursera's [Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/home/welcome) week 5 [exercise](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/notebook/ukh3t/methods-and-classes-optional).

### Description
Mock server and load balancer classes in load_balancer.py where connections can be added and removed by string address. As connections are added, average load is computed and additional servers are added to ensure average load is never greater than 50%.

### Execution and Unit Testing
Code can be executed via unit test cases in load_balancer_test.py using Python's [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest) testing framework.
